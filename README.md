# hello-world

Hi my name Is melissa

Most people call me Pinky, on the fact that i keep my hair fushcia/pink
Learning to be a devloper. Having trouble with javascript. So if anyone reads this and directs me to places to help me learn it
or helps me fix what i post, then id much appreciate it. Oddly i can read javascript pretty well and know what and why it does what it does
but i have trouble writing it myself, and even tweaking others code to work for me.
Html/css im pretty good at. and I'm looking forward to PHP which oddly enoughi  dont have much trouble with, even though its quite similar to javascript.
Anyway. Here i go back to learning and creating a new path and goal for myself.
